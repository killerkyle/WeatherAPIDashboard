Unit 06 Server-Side APIs Homework: Weather Dashboard

A weather dashboard which displays current weather and forecast for a searched city. Users can search for a city, and if found the app will return the current weather, as well as a forecast of the next 5 days. The user's search history is saved as a button for them to quickly check the weather of that city again.

Approach------

I divided the tasks to help the process of this in my head.

Get the user input city
Sending a request to the Openweather server then retrieving the current forecast.
Get the information to show on the screen.
I started with a functionality focus first, then on the styling. 
I created the the HTML & CSS first anyway and added as I went along. I tried matching the styling in the example image.

Challenges------

My challenges within this assignment was getting the 5 day forecast to work utilizing the Openweather API. The weather call has to return the forecast in bursts of three hours and uses up to 5 days past the date of today.
